This program uses the 7-segment display and the keypad module. The program generates a random string of four numbers and displays them in succession to the 7-seg display (the H-bridge is necessary to print out to the 7-seg display). The player must then enter the correct sequence on the keypad. If the players does so, the round increases to the next round, and the time between the display of each number shortens. As the rounds increase, the numbers display faster and faster.
